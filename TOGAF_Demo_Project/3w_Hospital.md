### 3w_Hospital Digital Transformation & TOGAF Roadmap

**Overview:**  
3w_Hospital currently relies on a traditional on-premises setup with a dedicated data center and localized applications. To boost scalability, flexibility, and operational efficiency while ensuring robust security and compliance, the hospital is transitioning to a hybrid architecture that blends on-premises systems with cloud services.

### SkyBlue Consulting’s TOGAF-Based Approach: 
SkyBlue Consulting has selected the TOGAF framework to guide this transformation. The initial phase—the Preliminary Phase—will establish the foundation for a successful project by:

- **Establishing the Architecture Framework:** Defining the scope, objectives, and governance model tailored to the hospital’s digital transformation.
- **Setting Architecture Principles:** Identifying key business drivers to align current operations with the envisioned hybrid environment.
- **Engaging Stakeholders:** Collaborating with IT, clinical teams, and management to ensure all requirements and expectations are captured.
- **Assessing the Current Environment:** Documenting existing systems and infrastructure to create a baseline for the future state.

This structured, enterprise-aligned approach will ensure a clear roadmap for the hospital’s strategic evolution and long-term IT success.

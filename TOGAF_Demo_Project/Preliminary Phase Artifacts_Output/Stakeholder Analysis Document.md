## 4. Baseline Architecture Assessment Document

**Purpose:**  
Document the current state of the hospital’s IT landscape. This “as-is” assessment provides a clear understanding of existing systems, infrastructure, and processes that will inform the target (hybrid) architecture design.

**Sample Content:**  
**Title:** 3w_Hospital Baseline Architecture Assessment  
**Overview:**  
3w_Hospital currently operates with a traditional on-premises model characterized by a dedicated data center and localized applications.  

**Current Infrastructure Details:**  
- **Data Center:**  
  - Single-site dedicated data center with legacy hardware  
  - Limited redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities  
- **Applications:**  
  - Locally hosted clinical and administrative systems  
  - Siloed data storage with limited integration  
- **Network & Security:**  
  - Traditional network security with perimeter-based defenses  
  - Compliance with basic IT security standards but facing challenges with evolving threats  
- **Operational Challenges:**  
  - Limited scalability and flexibility in adapting to increased workloads  
  - Increasing maintenance costs due to aging infrastructure

**Diagrams & Visuals:**  
- **Current State Diagram:** (A high-level diagram showing the on-premises data center, connected clinical systems, and isolated network segments)

### Summary

These four artifacts form the backbone of the Preliminary Phase in TOGAF and are critical to ensuring that all subsequent phases (from visioning to detailed design and implementation) are built on a clear, well-governed foundation. They help articulate the transformation’s rationale, align stakeholder expectations, and provide a comprehensive baseline for measuring future improvements.
